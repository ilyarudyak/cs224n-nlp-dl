# token level
TP = 3 (AMR, Tim, Wagner)
FP = 1 (American)
FN = 2 (Airlines, Corp.)

Precision = TP / (TP + FP) = 3 / 4
Recall =    TP / (TP + FN) = 3 / 5 # that's not 3 / 6 like in the text of the assignment

# entity level
TP = 1 ([Tim Wagner])
FP = 2 ([American], [AMR])
FN = 2 ([American Airlines], [AMR Corp.])

Precision = TP / (TP + FP) = 1 / 3
Recall =    TP / (TP + FN) = 1 / 3 # that's the same as in the assignment
